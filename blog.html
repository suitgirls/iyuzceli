        <h1>Machine Learning Meme</h1>
        <p>This meme about machine learning perfectly shows the refection of machine learning on the society. Also this meme states that how libraries used for machine learning makes it easier. Libraries used in machine learning are preconstructed and collected for saving us from writing the same sets of codes all over again. The reflection of machine learning is always thought to be complicated and hard. While it is analyzation of a dataset and training a model for computer to making able to recognize similar patterns. Also statistics serve as a foundation for analysis and dealing with data in data science. A lot of performance metrics used in machine learning algorithms like accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, root mean squared error, etc. use statistics as the base.</p>

        <h3>Who Is Genevieve Feinstein</h3>
        <p>
            Genevieve Marie Grotjan Feinstein (April 30, 1913 â€“ August 10, 2006) was an American mathematician and cryptanalyst. She worked for the Signals Intelligence Service throughout World War II, during which time she played an important role in deciphering the Japanese cryptography machine Purple, and later worked on the Cold War-era Venona project.

            After graduating as a math teacher with a degree she was unable to find a job as one so instead, she started working at the Railroad Retirement Board. She was working as a statistical clerk. She got the attention of William F. Friedman by scoring a high score on a civil service mathematics test. she was hired to work with him as a junior cryptanalyst for the Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS) for eight months. She aimed to analyze the encryption system used in the Japanese Type B Cipher Machine, code-named Purple by SIS. In 1940 the Chiper had cracked which she played an important role in cracking. For her wartime service, she was awarded the Exceptional Civilian Service Award.

        	Later she was assigned to the Venona project which had the aim to decode encrypted messages sent by Soviet KGB and  Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). She made Americans realize when an individual one-time pad cipher was (improperly) reused. She continued working at the SIS after World War II. After resigning because of the Cold War she started teaching at George Mason University as a Professor of Mathematics. Her significant works took place till 2006.
