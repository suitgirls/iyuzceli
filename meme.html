        <h1>Machine Learning Meme</h1>
        <p>This meme about machine learning perfectly shows the refection of machine learning on the society. Also this meme states that how libraries used for machine learning makes it easier. Libraries used in machine learning are preconstructed and collected for saving us from writing the same sets of codes all over again. The reflection of machine learning is always thought to be complicated and hard. While it is analyzation of a dataset and training a model for computer to making able to recognize similar patterns. Also statistics serve as a foundation for analysis and dealing with data in data science. A lot of performance metrics used in machine learning algorithms like accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, root mean squared error, etc. use statistics as the base.</p>
