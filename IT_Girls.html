        Hi! My name is Ipek I'm a rising junior. I live in Turkey/Istanbul. I have a great interest in computer science and technology. I decided to take this class to broaden my knowledge and interest. I am very into algorithms and software developing. I have just finished a research project on cancer early diagnosis with the help of machine learning. I can say that I am a big book worm. I enjoy books on phsycology, science fiction and fiction. I'm also a profecional swimmer. A funny detail about me is that I have a 6 eye sight so I may not recognize you without my contact lenses!
